Goal is to find ideal locations for a set of drone depots, based on the coordinates of the
clients.
Use the drone delivery dataset

Each row starts with a customer identifier, followed by the
geographical locations of nearly 6,000 clients.
1. Visualize the client locations by making a two-dimensional scatterplot.

Can you give a geographic interpretation for what you see?
Using k-means clustering, find optimal locations (i.e. x and y
coordinates) for three drone depots. Each depot should serve its
surrounding clients.

2. Attach the information on the closest depot to each client. That is, generate a data
frame that is similar to the original one with the exception that it has an additional
column that contains the identifier of the depot nearest to the client. Print the first 10
rows of the new data frame.

3. Make a scatterplot that uses three different colours. The markers with the same colour
are served by the same depot.

4. Play with the number of depots. What are the optimal locations for 10 depots, for
example? Do you see a difference in the computation time when the number of depots
increases?

5. Replace k-means with agglomerative hierarchical clustering and explore it with various
depot numbers. What are your observations?
