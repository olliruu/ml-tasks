Use the anime dataset and raiting dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database?select=rating.csv

1. What kind of preprocessing is necessary for the ratings dataset?

2. How do the recommendation algorithms (e.g. KNN and SVD) perform with a data set of
this magnitude? Do you encounter hardware limitations? If yes, how can you
circumvent some of the limitations to be able to carry on with the experiment?

3. Can you combine the information in the two files in a meaningful way to have the
recommender display the titles of the recommended movies?
