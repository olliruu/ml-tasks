Phishing refers to a family of online frauds where an Internet user is lured into submitting
his/her sensitive data for malicious purposes.

Goal is to construct a small yet useful decision tree that predicts whether a website is a phishing site or not.

1. An image of the final decision tree.

2. Written instructions for an internet analyst to make the decision of whether the website
is likely to be a phishing site or not. The instructions must match one-to-one with your
decision tree.

3. The accuracy estimate (percentage of correct classifications) of your decision tree.
