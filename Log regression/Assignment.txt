Your task is to make a diagnostic tool (not for real medical use) that asks a medical expert six
numerical quantities obtained by radiographic measurements of a patient:
1. pelvic incidence
2. pelvic tilt
3. lumbar lordosis angle
4. sacral slope
5. pelvic radius
6. grade of spondylolisthesis
As an output, your program should provide a probability estimate of the patient having a
vertebral abnormality (either disk hernia or spondylolisthesis).

The decisions of your diagnostic tool should be based on a logistic regression model derived
from the data set. If possible, provide evidence on the accuracy of your tool to convince the
ever-suspicious radiological community.
